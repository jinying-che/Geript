# Geript

**Geript** means geek's scripts, I name it. Here are some scripts that I use in daily development, they are really awesome and effective, make work more productive.

## Before Start
The scripts are basing on the `fd`, `fzf` and `rg`, make sure that they have already been installed first.
- **fd**: https://github.com/sharkdp/fd
- **rg**: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
- **fzf**: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

## Usage
- `f file`: find the file recursively, open it using vim
- `h command`: find the command in the history and execute
- `v keyword`: find the keyword recursively, open the file and move the cursor to the line that selected
